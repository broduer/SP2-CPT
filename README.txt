SuperPower 2 Covert Planning Tool (SP2-CPT)

- Thank you for your interest in SP2-CPT. This is a calculator to help with planning and executing covert affairs (part of the Military sphere) in SuperPower 2.
- SuperPower 2 Human Development Mod (SP2-HDM), regular SP2 1.5.1, and any mod that doesn't change how security and covert mission success rates are calculated, are supported.

Security tab:
- You can calculate how many Elite covert cells you need to acheive a certain security level, which depends on your country's population.
- 94.9% is the highest possible security level any country can achieve.

Mission tab:
- You can calculate how likely your covert mission will succeed.
- When performing a covert mission against yourself, various mission details, such as mission type and complexity, are irrelevant for calculating the success rate.
- In SP2-HDM, your success rate is also dependent on how many other active cells you have in your target country.
- Only the success rate of a coup mission, and not any other mission type, depends on the target country's stability level.
- For the range of success rates that you will get from the calculator, the lower boundary is for if your target has a 94.9% security level, and the higher boundary is for if your target has 0.0% security.
- If and only if you succeed your mission, even when you're targeting yourself, then there will be a probability of you being found out as the true perpetrator. The calculator gives you that probability in the case that your target has 94.9% security; that probability is always 0% if your target has 0.0% security, and it'll be somewhere in between if your target has between 0.0% and 94.9% security.
- If you fail your mission, even when you're targeting yourself, then you will always be found out as the perpetrator, and you will always have a 33% chance of having your cell captured (i.e. removed from the game).
