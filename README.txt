SuperPower 2 Covert Planning Tool (SP2-CPT) 2

- Thank you for your interest in SP2-CPT. This is a calculator to help with planning and executing covert affairs (part of the Military sphere) in SuperPower 2.
- SuperPower 2 Human Development Mod (SP2-HDM) V6, regular SP2 V1.5.1, and any mod that doesn't change how security and covert mission success rates are calculated, are supported.

Security tab:
- You can calculate how many Elite covert cells you need to acheive a certain security level, which depends on your country's population.
- 94.9% is the highest possible security level any country can achieve.

Mission tab:
- You can calculate how likely your covert mission will succeed.
- When performing a covert mission against yourself, various mission details, such as mission type and complexity, are irrelevant for calculating the success rate.
- In SP2-HDM, your success rate is also dependent on how many other active cells you have in your target country.
- Only the success rate of a coup mission, and not any other mission type, depends on the target country's stability level.
- For the range of success rates that you will get from the calculator, the lower boundary is for if your target has a 94.9% security level, and the higher boundary is for if your target has 0.0% security.
- If and only if you succeed your mission, even when you're targeting yourself, then there will be a probability of you being found out as the true perpetrator. The calculator gives you that probability in the case that your target has 94.9% security; that probability is always 0% if your target has 0.0% security, and it'll be somewhere in between if your target has between 0.0% and 94.9% security.
- If you fail your mission, even when you're targeting yourself, then you will always be found out as the perpetrator, and you will always have a 33% chance of having your cell captured (i.e. removed from the game).

Other notes:
- SP2-CPT requires Qt 5.5.1 to build and run. If the application package that you downloaded did not come with the required Qt DLLs, then you may obtain the DLLs at http://www.qt.io/download-open-source (Windows 32-bit, MinGW 4.9.2).
